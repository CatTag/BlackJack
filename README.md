# BlackJack
The concept of this is simply BlackJack but using only simple shapes in raylib.                                                                          

# Build guide
Linux/MacOS:                                                                            
1. Install raylib from your package manger (pacman -S raylib on arch).                   
2. Compile using your C compiler of choice (gcc -lraylib -lm used for testing).               
3. chmod +x the output file and have fun :)                                                 

Windows:                                                                                              
Don't know and don't really care. You need raylib and a c compiler so good luck i guess.
